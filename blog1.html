                    So, you've heard of cryptocurrency, but it's too much for you to wrap your head around? You might be
                    wondering if cryptocurrency will become the norm in the future of currency. Let's take a look at it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of currency in which encryption techniques are applied to regulate the
                    generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a
                    central bank. Bitcoins, for example, are a type of cryptocurrency.

                    Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology â€” a distributed
                    ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that
                    they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to
                    government interference or manipulation.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How does it differ from the regular currency?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Governments issue fiat currencies, which are in return regulated by the central bank. Fiat money is
                    deemed legal tender in that it is often the official means of finalizing transactions. Governments
                    control the fiat money supply and issue policies from time to time that affects their value.

                    Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are merely digital assets that act as a medium of exchange that
                    governments have no control over. The decentralization aspect means no central body can control or
                    influence their value. Cryptocurrencies exist in digital form as they are created by computers and
                    operate as private pieces of code. The means of exchange are thus purely digital.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What are the advantages of using cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A cryptocurrency transaction is generally a quick and straightforward process. For example, Bitcoins
                    can be transferred from one digital wallet to another, using only a smartphone or computer.

                    Every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain, which is the
                    technology that enables its existence. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to
                    stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies, or undoing transactions.

                    Blockchain aims to cut out intermediaries, such as banks and online marketplaces, which means there
                    are no payment processing fees.

                    Cryptocurrency payments are becoming more widely used, amongst large organizations, and in sectors
                    including fashion and pharmaceuticals.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cryptocurrency works a lot like PayPal or a credit card, except you exchange digital assets for goods
                    and services instead of US dollars. To make a transaction with cryptocurrency, you must exchange
                    currency with a peer using a digital wallet known as a cryptocurrency wallet. A cryptocurrency
                    wallet is software that allows you to transfer funds from one account to another. To complete a
                    transaction, you need access to a password, known as a private key. The private key is much like a
                    bank account. You can own multiple keys and own all the funds sent to those keys. Transactions are
                    recorded on a public ledger, which shows the transaction totals without revealing the identities of
                    the parties involved.

                    Cryptocurrency mining is the process required to verify transactions. It involves a massive amount
                    of computing power and complicated algorithms, but those who are successful at solving problems
                    through mining can earn reward coins, tokens, or transaction fees.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Pros and Cons of Using Cryptocurrency</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is very fast, easy, and cheap to use. It is cheaper (Or Free) than other monetary
                    transactions like PayPal, Payoneer, etc. Cryptocurrency is fully secure and your details are fully
                    safe in it. There are Peer to Peer transactions and everyone can see each transaction on the
                    blockchain. There are no boundaries for transactions.

                    In Cryptocurrency payment is not reversible. If you lose your wallet, there is no way to recover it
                    back. Not all websites accept these digital currencies, only a few websites.

                    There are only two countries that are using cryptocurrency in advanced mode: Switzerland and
                    Singapore. Slowly and steadily it is consolidating its position in the world economy and we can see
                    that from bitcoin</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Popularity of Cryptocurrency</h2>
                <br>
                <p>People in the world's major conflict zones are turning to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as soaring
                    values and the backing of super-rich investors make them more attractive.

                    Online searches for bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin have increased in Libya, Syria, and Palestine,
                    pushing aside the usual focus of interest in stock markets and safe-haven investments in gold and
                    property.

                    Publicity surrounding the new breed of digital currencies has spread across the world since the
                    pandemic struck and meant users have also looked to them as a way to borrow when banks have become
                    reluctant to lend money. Tesla's owner, Elon Musk, is among the most high-profile supporters, adding
                    his tweets of approval to other celebrity backers including the actor Gwyneth Paltrow, the rapper
                    Snoop Dogg, and the billionaire former Microsoft chair Bill Gates. Online inquires made up 42.2% of
                    the total in Libya, 41.9% in Ukraine, and 38.7% in Palestine, putting them all in the top five for
                    cryptocurrency searches while Syria at 36.9% was 10th, suggesting that countries with high levels of
                    instability are proportionally more interested in digital assets than more developed nations.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is the need of the era. After fiat currency, digital currencies are the future &
                    people are adopting them day by day. People want financial freedom & want to keep their savings in
                    crypto rather than in fiat currency at banks. They also like to keep their savings in
                    cryptocurrencies to get profit because they know what would be the value of this in the future. As
                    we know fiat currencies drop their values over time & countries print their fiat currency as much as
                    they want each year. That's the reason people prefer crypto over fiat currency. People who are not
                    still learning or adopting crypto In the future it might be damn expensive to acquire them.</p>
