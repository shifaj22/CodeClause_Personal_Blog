                    Artificial intelligence is the future and everyone is depending on it lately, the world is going
                    crazy about Artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines
                    and the branch of computer science that studies how to create intelligent machines. Without drawing
                    a distinction, the terms “artificial intelligence,” and “machine intelligence,” are sometimes used
                    interchangeably, while others use “artificial intelligence” to refer specifically to a subset rather
                    than the whole. It has become a popular buzzword in business and industry, and has given rise to
                    many new technological innovations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction to AI</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new
                    technologies day by day.

                    Here, one of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial Intelligence which is ready
                    to create a new revolution in the world by making intelligent machines. AI holds a tendency to cause
                    a machine to work as a human. Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human based
                    skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems

                    With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to pre-program a machine to do some work, despite that
                    you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with own intelligence, and that
                    is the awesomeness of AI.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Artificial intelligence in last 20 years</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The past two decades have witnessed the great rise of Artificial Intelligence. The technology has
                    made an impact in almost every field out there. This expectation that intelligent artefacts should
                    by necessity be human-like artefacts blinded most of us to the important fact that we have been
                    achieving AI for some time. While the breakthroughs in surpassing human ability at human pursuits,
                    such as chess (Hsu, 2002), Go (Silver et al., 2016), and translation (Wu et al., 2016), make
                    headlines, AI has been a standard part of the industrial repertoire since at least the 1980s.

                    This capacity to use AI for discovery has been extended not only by the massive increase of digital
                    data and available computing power, but also by innovations in AI and ML algorithms. We are now
                    searching photographs, videos, and audio (Barrett et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). We can translate,
                    transcribe, read lips, read emotions (including lying), forge signatures and other handwriting, and
                    forge video (Hancock et al., 2007; Eyben et al., 2013; Assail et al., 2016; Haines et al., 2016;
                    Reed et al., 2016; Vincent, 2016; Schuler et al., 2016; Sartori et al., 2016; This et al., 2016;
                    Deng et al., 2017; Chung and Zisserman, 2017). Critically, we can forge real-time audio/video during
                    live transmissions, allowing us to choose the words millions “witness,” particularly for celebrities
                    such as politicians for whom there is already a great deal of data for composing accurate models
                    (Thies et al., 2016; Suwajanakorn et al., 2017). At the time of this writing, there is increasing
                    evidence that the outcomes of the 2016 US presidential election and UK referendum on EU membership
                    were both altered by the AI detection and targeting of “swing voters” via their public social-media
                    use (Cadwalladr, 2017a,b; ICO, 2018), not to mention the AI-augmented tools used in cyber hacking
                    (Brundage et al., 2018).

                    AI is here now, available to and benefiting us all. But its consequences for our social order are
                    not only not understood, but have until recently barely even yet been the subject of study (Bryson,
                    2015). Yet now too, with advances in robotics, AI is entering our physical spaces in the form of
                    autonomous vehicles, weapons, drones, and domestic devices, including “smart speakers” (really,
                    microphones) and even games consoles (Jia et al., 2016). We are becoming surrounded by — even
                    embedded in — pervasive automated perception, analysis, and increasingly action.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Impact of AI</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Artificial intelligence can dramatically improve the efficiencies of our workplaces and can augment
                    the work humans can do. When AI takes over repetitive or dangerous tasks, it frees up the human
                    workforce to do work they are better equipped for — tasks that involve creativity and empathy among
                    others. If people are doing work that is more engaging for them, it could increase happiness and job
                    satisfaction. It's fascinating the way Artificial Intelligence has become involved in our existence
                    and we encounter it in our daily lives without even realizing it.

                    From aiding in avoiding traffic, offering movies or music recommendations, voice-controlled personal
                    digital assistants, the popular self-driving cars and vehicles, instant translation of machines and
                    various other power-packed predictive capabilities are just some applications of the forms
                    Artificial Intelligence has taken up today. There are various other examples of AI being leveraged
                    in our everyday lives.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How is Artificial Intelligence different from Human Intelligence?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>So how is AI different from human intelligence? Artificial intelligence and the algorithms that make
                    this intelligence run are designed by humans, and while the computer can learn and adapt or grow
                    from its surroundings, at the end of the day it was created by humans. Human intelligence has a far
                    greater capacity for multitasking, memories, social interactions, and self-awareness. Intelligence
                    that is artificial doesn't have an I.Q. making it very different from humans and human intelligence.
                    There are so many facets of thought and decision making that artificial intelligence simply can't
                    master — computing feelings just isn't something that we can train a machine to do, no matter how
                    smart it is. You can't automate multitasking or create autonomous relationships. Cognitive learning
                    and machine learning will always be unique and separate from each other. While AI applications can
                    run quickly, and be more objective and accurate, its capability stops at being able to replicate
                    human intelligence. Human thought encompasses so much more that a machine simply can't be taught, no
                    matter how intelligent it is or what formulas you use.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new
                    inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today — from chess-playing
                    computers to self-driving cars — rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing.
                    Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large
                    amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

                    Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a
                    branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify
                    patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

                    Deep learning is a type of machine learning that trains a computer to perform human-like tasks, such
                    as recognizing speech, identifying images or making predictions.

                    Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers
                    understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP helps computers communicate with humans in
                    their own language, making it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it,
                    measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

                    Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and
                    understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models,
                    machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see”. From
                    recognizing faces to processing the live action of a football game, computer vision rivals and
                    surpasses human visual abilities in many areas.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Artificial Intelligence: The Future</h2>
                <br>
                <p>AI systems are already impacting how we live, and the door to the future is wide open for how it will
                    impact us in the future. AI-driven technology will likely continue to improve efficiency and
                    productivity and expand into even more industries over time. Experts say there will likely be more
                    discussions on privacy, security, and continued software development to help keep people and
                    businesses safe as AI advances.

                    While many people are worried that robots will end up taking their jobs, the truth is that there are
                    many fields are fairly safe from automation. Fields like IT will continue to be needed to adopt the
                    new technologies and security systems that make AI run. Healthcare professionals and teachers won’t
                    be able to be replaced by robot, the work they do directly with patients and children is something
                    that can’t be replicated. Similarly in business some processes can be automated, but human instinct,
                    decision making, and relationships will always be vital for the future.

                    Artificial intelligence is transforming the way the world runs, and will continue to do so as time
                    marches on. Now is an ideal time to get involved and get a degree in IT that can help propel you to
                    an exciting AI career. You can be a part of the world-changing revolution that is artificial
                    intelligence.</p>
