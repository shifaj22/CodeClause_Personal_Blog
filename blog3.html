                <br>
                <h2>So what is Automated Machine learning?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focus on the use of data
                    and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Automated
                    machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to
                    real-world problems. AutoML potentially includes every stage beginning with a raw dataset to
                    building a machine learning model ready for deployment. AutoML was proposed as an artificial
                    intelligence-based solution to the growing challenge of applying machine learning. The high degree
                    of automation in AutoML aims to allow non-experts to make use of machine learning models and
                    techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How does the AutoML process work?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>AutoML is typically a platform or open source library that simplifies each step in the machine
                    learning process, from handling a raw dataset to deploying a practical machine learning model. In
                    traditional machine learning, models are developed by hand, and each step in the process is handled
                    separately.

                    AutoML automatically locates and uses the optimal type of machine learning algorithm for a given
                    task. It does this with two concepts:

                    · Neural architecture search automates the design of neural networks. This helps AutoML models
                    discover new architectures for problems that require them.

                    · In Transfer learning pretrained models apply what they have learned to the new data sets. Transfer
                    learning helps AutoML apply existing architectures to new problems that require it.

                    Users with minimal machine learning and deep learning knowledge can interface with the models
                    through a relatively simple coding language like Python.

                    More specifically, here are some of the steps of the machine learning process that AutoML can
                    automate, in the order, they occur in the process:<br>
                    <br>
                    · Raw data processing<br>
                    <br>
                    · Feature engineering and feature selection<br>
                    <br>
                    · Model selection<br>
                    <br>
                    · Hyper parameter optimization and parameter optimization<br>
                    <br>
                    · Deployment with consideration for business and technology constraints<br>
                    <br>
                    · Evaluation metric selection<br>
                    <br>
                    · Monitoring and problem checking<br>
                    <br>
                    · Analysis of results<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>The main benefits of AutoML are:</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Efficiency:<br>
                    It speeds up and simplifies the machine learning process and reduces the training time
                    of machine learning models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cost savings: <br>
                    A faster, more efficient machine learning process means a company can save money by
                    devoting less of its budget to maintaining that process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Accessibility:<br>
                     Having a simple process allows companies to save money on training staff or hiring
                    experts. It also makes machine learning a viable possibility for a wider range of companies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Performance:<br>
                     AutoML algorithms also tend to be more efficient than hand-coded models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end offers the advantages of producing
                    simple solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed
                    models. Common techniques used in AutoML include hyper parameter optimization, meta-learning, and
                    neural architecture search.
