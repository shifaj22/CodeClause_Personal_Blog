                    Non-fungible tokens (NFT) have finally arrived on Instagram after Meta announced on Thursday the
                    long-awaited arrival of its digital collectible feature to its millions of users in the U.S.<br>
                    <br>
                    Meta announced on 29th Sept that all Facebook and Instagram users in the U.S. can now connect their
                    wallets and share their NFTs. All users in the U.S. also can cross-post the NFTs that they own
                    across both Facebook and Instagram. The official rollout comes a few months after Meta first began
                    testing NFTs with select users on Instagram in May, and on Facebook in June.<br>
                    <br>
                    The company also launched NFT support on Instagram in 100 countries in August with select users.
                    Today, Meta announced that all users in these 100 countries can now access the feature on Instagram.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Today we're announcing everyone on Facebook and Instagram in the U.S. can now connect their wallets
                    and share their digital collectibles,” Meta said in the post. “Additionally, everyone in the 100
                    countries where digital collectibles are available on Instagram can now access the feature.”<br>
                    <br>
                    To post a digital collectible, all you need to do is connect your digital wallet to Instagram. As of
                    today, it supports connections with third-party wallets including Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet,
                    Coinbase Wallet, and Dapper Wallet coming soon. Supported blockchains at this time include Ethereum,
                    Polygon, and Flow. There are no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on
                    Instagram.
