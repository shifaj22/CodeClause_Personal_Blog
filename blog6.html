                <p class="text-small">
                    Here is an explanation of how to implement an E-Voting System using Blockchain technology.

                    This project was designed and developed by me for my final year.

                    You can get the source code at https://github.com/shifaj22/E-Voting_System_Blockchain . Blockchain
                    is a technology rapidly gaining momentum in the era of Industry 4.0. With high security
                    and transparency provisions, it is being widely used in supply chain management systems, healthcare,
                    payments, business, IoT, voting systems, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Why do we need this?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security
                    threats such as DDoS attacks, polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, malware
                    attacks, etc, and require vast amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense
                    of distrust among existing systems. Using blockchain, the voting process can be made more secure,
                    transparent, immutable, and reliable.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Programming Languages used:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>For Smart Contract: Solidity</h3>
                <p>
                    Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network
                    team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.

                    Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Development Tools:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Truffle:</h3>
                <p>Truffle is a world-class development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for
                    blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
                    Truffle is widely considered the most popular tool for blockchain application development.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Ganache:</h3>

                <p>Ganache is a software tool that developers widely use to create a local blockchain network for
                    testing and development purposes. Developers may effectively test different scenarios and
                    troubleshoot their blockchain apps by simulating a blockchain network on their local PC with
                    Ganache.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>First, you need to download and install these:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Node.js / npm</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Truffle</h3>
                <p>npm i truffle</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Ganache</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Also, do not forget to add MetaMask Extension to your browser.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Install these additional packages just in case to avoid errors:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Web3.js: npm i web3 <br>
                    <br>
                    Solidity (solc-js): npm i solc
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Steps to implement the project:</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 1:</h3>
                <p>Clone the GitHub repository “git clone https://github.com/shifaj22/E-Voting_System_Blockchain “</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 2:</h3>

                <p>Connecting MetaMask and Ganache

                    In MetaMask, go to settings > networks > add network. You can also get to this by clicking the
                    MetaMask extension pinned on your browser > clicking the profile picture > settings > networks > add
                    network. <br>
                    <br>
                    Name the network Ganache. <br>
                    <br>
                    For the New RPC URL go to ganache where you'll copy the RPC server URL and paste it into Metamask.
                    The chain ID for the ganache is 1337. <br>
                    <br>
                    You can name the currency symbol “ETH” and save.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 3:</h3>
                <p>Check the truffle-config.js file. The port number should be set to 7545 as we are not using the
                    ganache-cli.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 4:</h3>
                <p>cd E-Voting_System_Blockchain <br>
                    <br>
                    npm i <br>
                    <br>
                    truffle migrate — reset <br>
                    <br>
                    (You should see the contract being deployed. To confirm whether the contract has been deployed or
                    not, open Ganache and check if Ethereum is deducted from the first account, it should be 99.99 ETH)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    npm start
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 5:</h3>
                <p>Importing an account from Ganache to MetaMask. <br>
                    <br>
                    Open ganache and click on the key icon of the first account. The show keys button is the key icon.
                    Copy the private key and click done. <br>
                    <br>
                    [NOTE: The first account in ganache is used for admin login. Make sure to import the private key of
                    the first account into MetaMask to access the Admin Panel] <br>
                    <br>
                    Open the MetaMask menu which can be accessed by clicking the profile picture and selecting import
                    account. <br>
                    <br>
                    Paste the private key copied from ganache and click import.
                </p>


                <br>
                <p>After the project successfully runs on localhost:3000, register yourself as the admin, you can also
                    access the Admin Panel and add candidates. After adding the candidates click on the “Start Election”
                    button.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you want to add different users/voters then, import the private keys of different accounts from
                    Ganache to MetaMask and connect those accounts to the current site and register as a different
                    user/voter to cast a vote.</p>
